### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vasiliy, 
I'm junior Unity developer. Sometimes I code on **TypeScript**, **C/C++** but
not experiencing big troubles about using such languages as **Python** or **Java**. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ASBTD - a tiny shooter with basic mechanics 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Zenject**, **UniRX** (in plans), **LeoECS** **DOTween**, **VFX Graph**, TypeScript (React & Express)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always curious about middle-level things such as pointers, memory allocation.
