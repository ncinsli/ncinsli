### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vasiliy, 
I'm junior Unity developer. Sometimes I code on **TypeScript**, **C/C++** but
not experiencing big troubles about using such languages as **Python** or 
**Java**. 
Always curious about middle-level things such as pointers, memory allocation.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ConnectD - a messages hooking service
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning latest of SOLID principles and advanced patterns (**ECS**, **Observer**, **State**), TypeScript (React & Express)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always curious about middle-level things such as pointers, memory allocation.
